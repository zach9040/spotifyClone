Project Write Up

Team Members: Zachary Huang
Prompt: Spotify Client
Abstract
My app is an imitation Spotify Client that lists out a set of songs which can then be played.  
Components**:**
My song component displays all the songs on the account, my recently deleted component keeps track of the past songs, my currently playing component keeps track of the current song and also contains components for playing a new random song, as well as the previous songs.  
Features:
My spotify client is supposed to play songs, keep track of recently deleted, and is able to shuffle and go back to previous songs.  Due to not having time to hook it up to Spotify API, it has the proper react components and state, but not the functionality.

Division of Labor:
Zach : Did all of it
